# Hello-World. Hello world, to introduce myself a bit, my name is Michael Sean Von Grodkowski. Yes. It does sound awesome.I was raised by wolves in the Tibetian mountains for 6 years before being found by a travelling wealthy man from Japan who raised me in the ways of the ninja for about 10 years. I then was sent to Europe where I wa adopted by a wealthy noble family and spent a couple of years learning the editquitte and decorum that fits such a household. And in the more recent years have moved to the United States. --- But, false history aside: I studied for two years at Utah State University before transferring down here so that I can get a degree in animation. I have served a mission, as well as grew up taking martial art classes, in fact I actually taught a class for a time. Hmm, other things about myself. I like long walks on the beach under the moonlight... probably. I wouldn't know as I've never been to a proper beach.
